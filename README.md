### Asset Browser Setup

The addon automatically configures the Asset Browser for each project:

2. Sets up standard catalogs (Props, Characters, Environments)
3. Manages asset previews and metadata

## Workflow

2. Click "Create Asset"
3. Choose asset type and settings
4. Asset is automatically categorized and available in the Asset Browser

### Assembly Management

1. Open shot assembly using "Open Assembly"
2. Use "Rebuild Assembly" to update links
3. "Prepare for Render" to create render-ready file

## Best Practices

- **File Organization**:
  - Keep WIP files in WIP folders
  - Always publish before linking to assembly
  - Use standardized naming conventions

- **Asset Management**:
  - Create clean, self-contained assets
  - Use proper categorization
  - Keep asset files lightweight

- **Version Control**:
  - Regular WIP saves
  - Clear publish descriptions
  - Verify links before publishing
